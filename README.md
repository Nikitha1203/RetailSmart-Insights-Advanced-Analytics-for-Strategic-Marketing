# RetailSmart-Insights-Advanced-Analytics-for-Strategic-Marketing
## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict which departments will be affected by markdowns and to what extent. We will use advanced machine learning methods to:

* Predict the department-wide sales for each store
* Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks
* Provide marketing recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on largest business impact.

## Materials and Methods

We will use the following materials and methods in this lab:

* Python
* Pandas
* SeaBorn
* Scikit-learn
* Keras

## Data

We will use the following datasets in this lab:

* Store sales data: This dataset contains 3 years of sales data for 45 stores located in different regions.
* Department data: This dataset contains information about the departments in each store.
* Regional data: This dataset contains information about the region in which each store is located.

## Steps

The steps involved in this lab are as follows:

1. Import Libraries/Define Auxiliary Functions
2. Download and pre-preparation data
3. Predict the department-wide sales
    * Previus Data Analysis
    * DataSet creation
    * Data normalization
    * Linear Regression
    * Back Propagation Neural Network
    * Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM
4. Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks
    * Preliminary analysis
    * Linear Regression
    * Back Propagation Neural Network
    * Sensitivity analisys
5. Recommendation for department
6. Final Task
    * SubTask 1. Sensitifity function
    * SubTask 2. Sensitivity of Department
    * SubTask 3. Sensitivity of 10 departments
## Results

The results of this lab are as follows:

* We were able to predict the department-wide sales for each store with a high degree of accuracy.
* We were able to model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks.
* We were able to provide marketing recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on largest business impact.
